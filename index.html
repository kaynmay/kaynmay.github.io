      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm an aspiring Software Developer from Dallas, TX. I have experience with front-end development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript) and Python. In 2017, I graduated from the University of Texas
        at Austin with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics specializing in Scientific Computation. Through one of my required courses, I was introduced to computer science and
        discovered my talent and passion for programming. In my free time, I enjoy reading, discovering new music, watching movies, and keeping up with US Politics. I also have an interest
        in art, graphic design, and photography. Feel free to follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/starliqhtly">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/starliqhtly">Twitter</a> for
        more updates!</p>
