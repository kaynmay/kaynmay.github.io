              <h2>Full Stack Open 2021</h2>
              <p>
                Deep dive into modern web development course I have been going
                through starting September 2021. Each part of the course has
                exercises to complete on your own using what was just learned. I
                have created several React apps using hooks, state, and event
                handlers.

              <h2>Rain Data</h2>
              <p>
                Python automation script that turned a daily 30 minute process
                into being fully automated. A coworker at my company had a daily
                task of going into DAT files and calculating the total rainfall
                from the last 24 hours to enter into our Asset Management
                system. I was tasked with finding a way to automate this
                process. I created a script that copied over the DAT files,
                calculated the total rainfall at each site, and wrote the totals
                to a CSV file.

              <h2>Four Seasons</h2>
              <p>
                Processing animation project that displays the four seasons.
                This was the final project for my Graphics and Visualization
                course that was developed by two other students and myself. Each
                season is displayed with a pixel art representation as the
                background, an animation that runs on top of the background, and
                the appropriate section of Vivaldi's Four Seasons as audio.
